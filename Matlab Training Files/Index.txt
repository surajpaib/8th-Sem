1. costFunction.m
Function to implement the J(theta)-Classification cost and find grad. The gradient at a particular theta
This function gets parameters from maintrain and fmincg

2.maintrain.m

Function to load datasets- X,Xvalidation and Xtest. Splits the data sets and starts the training algorithm that extracts grad and cost values from costFunction

3. lambdavalidation.m

Takes trained values of theta from maintrain.m after training over n iterations. Uses this lambda value to find training, validation and test accuracy to select the best model for all tried values of lambda

4. mean2.m

Gets the Statistical data from gesture coordinates. Namely- mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis.

5. gestacquire.m

Gets the gesture data and transforms into a workable matrix 

6.sigmoid.m

Find the sigmoid of a function

7. randInitializeWeights.m

Intializes random weights to a matrix
