Welcome to the DataSet.

The repository contains varied datasets collected by 4 different people under different variations. Each folder with a particular persons records is split into 3 gestures.

Gesture 1 > Hello
Gesture 2 > Welcome
Gesture 3 > Good 

in Indian Sign Language.

Each folder with gesture has different variants in the form of variantxx.png and variantxx.xls

The png file is a binary sampled down version of the coordinates in 2D ( This is done for quick visualization of joint positions and skeleton)

The XLS file contains the 3 dimension location of each joint in the upper body

The rows correspond to joint number and columns correspond to x y z coordinates ( in that order)

Joints 3 - 12 are considered as they belong to the upper body,
